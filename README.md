#extension-admob

OpenFL extension for "Google AdMob" on iOS and Android.
This extension allows you to easily integrate Google AdMob on your OpenFL (or HaxeFlixel) game / application.

###Main Features

* Banners & Interstitial Support.
* Setup your banners to be on top or on the bottom of the screen.
* Allows you to specify min amount of time between interstitial displays (to avoid annoying your users).
* Allows you to specify min amount of calls to interstitial before it actually gets displayed (to avoid annoying your users).
* Callback support for Interstitial Events.
* Mediation support

###Simple use Example

```haxe
// This example show a simple use case.

import extension.admob.AdMob;
import extension.admob.GravityMode;

class MainClass {

	function new() {
		// first of all, decide if you want to display testing ads by calling enableTestingAds() method.
		// Note that if you decide to call enableTestingAds(), you must do that before calling INIT methods.
		AdMob.enableTestingAds();

		// If you want to get instertitial events (LOADING, LOADED, CLOSED, DISPLAYING, ETC), provide
		// some callback function for this.
		AdMob.onInterstitialEvent = onInterstitialEvent;

		AdMob.onGetReward = rewardCb;

		
		// then call init with Android and iOS banner IDs in the main method.
		// parameters are (appId:String, bannerId:String, interstitialId:String, rewardedId:String, gravityMode:GravityMode).
		// if you don't have the bannerId and interstitialId, go to www.google.com/ads/admob to create them.
		
		AdMob.initAndroid("ca-app-pub-XXXXX123456", "ca-app-pub-XXXXX123456", "ca-app-pub-XXXXX123456","ca-app-pub-XXXXX123457", GravityMode.BOTTOM); // may also be GravityMode.TOP
		AdMob.initIOS("ca-app-pub-XXXXX123458","ca-app-pub-XXXXX123459", GravityMode.BOTTOM); // may also be GravityMode.TOP

		// NOTE: If your game allows screen rotation, you should call AdMob.onResize(); when rotation happens.
	}

	function showRewardedVideo() {
		AdMob.showRewardedAd();
	}
	
	function gameOver() {
		// some implementation
		AdMob.showInterstitial(0);

		/* NOTE:
		showInterstitial function has two parameters you can use to control how often you want to display the interstitial ad.

		public static function showInterstitial(minInterval:Int=60, minCallsBeforeDisplay:Int=0);

		* The banner will not show if it was displayed less than "minInterval" seconds ago.
		* The banner will show only after "#minCallsBeforeDisplay" calls to showInterstitial function.

		- To display an interstitial after every time the game finishes, call:
		AdMob.showInterstitial(0);
		- To avoid displaying the interstitial if the game was too short (60 seconds), call:
		AdMob.showInterstitial(60);
		- To display an interstitial every 3 finished games call:
		AdMob.showInterstitial(0,3);
		- To display an interstitial every 3 finished games (but never before 120 secs since last display), call:
		AdMob.showInterstitial(120,3); */
	}
	
	function mainMenu() {
		// some implementation
		AdMob.showBanner(); // this will show the AdMob banner.
	}

	function beginGame() {
		// some implementation
		AdMob.hideBanner(); // if you don't want the banner to be on screen while playing... call AdMob.hideBanner();
	}
	
	function onInterstitialEvent(event:String) {
		trace("THE INSTERSTITIAL IS "+event);
		/*
		Note that the "event" String will be one of this:
		    AdMob.LEAVING
		    AdMob.FAILED
		    AdMob.CLOSED
		    AdMob.DISPLAYING
		    AdMob.LOADED
		    AdMob.LOADING
		
		So, you can do something like:
		if(event == AdMob.CLOSED) trace("The player dismissed the ad!");
		else if(event == AdMob.LEAVING) trace("The player clicked the ad :), and we're leaving to the ad destination");
		else if(event == AdMob.FAILED) trace("Failed to load the ad... the extension will retry automatically.");
		*/
	}

	function onRewarded(rewardType:String, amount:Int):Void
	{

	}
	
}

```

###How to Install

To install this library, you can simply get the library from haxelib like this:
```bash
haxelib install extension-admob
```

Also, you'll need to download the google-play-services_lib and android-support-v4 from your Android SDK Manager. To do that, you need to execute the android tool from:
```bash
$ANDROID_SDK/tools/android
```

Then select *Google Play Services* and *Android Support Library* under the "Extras" section.

Once this is done, you just need to add this to your project.xml
```xml
<haxelib name="extension-admob" />
```

Also, you may need to set android sdk version to 23 or higher (as some versions of support-library-v4 and google play services requires this:
```xml
<android target-sdk-version="23" if="android" />
```

To add mediation :
```xml
<set name="facebook-mediation" />
<set name="inmobi-mediation" />
<set name="applovin-mediation" />
<set name="vungle-mediation" /> 
<set name="chartboost-mediation" /> 
<set name="unity-mediation" />
```
